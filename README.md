# YellowFox-Engine
 Friday Night Funkin' but in the funny snake language!

The yellowfox engine is a friday night funkin' engine developed fully in python using the pygame library.

It's filesystem was made to be intuitive and easy to add / remove / modify content inside the engine, so feel free to do it.

The repository itself contains only the source code, if you want the actual working game, go for the releases!
